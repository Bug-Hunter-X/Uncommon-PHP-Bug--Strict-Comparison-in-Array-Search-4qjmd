# Uncommon PHP Bug: Strict Comparison in Array Search

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to strict comparison (===) when searching for a specific value within an array.  The bug arises when the array might contain values that are loosely equal to the target value but not strictly equal.

## Bug Description

The original `bug.php` file contains a function that searches for a specific value ('target') in an array and returns its key. It uses strict comparison (===), which can lead to unexpected behavior if the array contains values that are loosely equal to 'target' but have different data types.

## Solution

The corrected code in `bugSolution.php` addresses this issue by using a more robust approach. It carefully handles various data type scenarios and avoids unexpected behavior.  Loose comparison is handled correctly, preventing the error condition.
